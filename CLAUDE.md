# Vadalkar & Associates — Corporate Website

Corporate website for Vadalkar & Associates, a structural and civil engineering consultancy in Mumbai established in 1994.

## Scope

This is the **main corporate website only**. The `blog/` subdirectory is a separate standalone project (Reflections Blog for Kirty Vadalkar) managed in a different chat — **do not modify anything in `blog/`**.

## Live URLs
- **New site**: https://vadalkar-website.vercel.app (deployed on Vercel, connected to GitHub)
- **Original site**: http://vadalkar.com (legacy table-based HTML from 2007, no HTTPS)
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/vedangv/vadalkar-website

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 16 (App Router) + TypeScript + React 19
- Tailwind CSS 4 (inline @theme in globals.css)
- Framer Motion 12 (animations via FadeIn component)
- Font: Inter (Google Fonts)

## Architecture
- 8 base routes: `/` (home), `/about`, `/projects`, `/team`, `/contact`, `/careers`, `/projects/[category]`, `/projects/[category]/[slug]`
- Dynamic routes: 17 category pages + 11 featured project detail pages (SSG via `generateStaticParams`)
- Shared layout: Header (fixed, always white) + Footer + WhatsAppButton + ScrollToTop
- Logo: `/public/banner.gif` (no invert trick — header always white)
- Project data: 386 projects in `src/data/projects.ts` across 17 categories (client-side filtering with scroll arrows on /projects, SSG for category/detail pages)
- Featured project descriptions in `src/data/featured-projects.ts`
- No CMS — all content is static in component files
- Contact form: submits to `/api/contact` endpoint

## Design System
- **Primary**: Navy blue (#1e3a5f) — professionalism
- **Accent**: Gold/amber (#d97706) — engineering warmth
- **Neutral**: Slate scale (#f8fafc to #0f172a)
- **Background**: White (#ffffff)
- Editorial/magazine aesthetic inspired by WSP/Arup engineering sites
- Consistent section pattern: accent line + uppercase label + large heading
